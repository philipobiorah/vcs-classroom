Introduction to VCS. Purpose: For students to practice Git workflow  
# VCS Classroom (Year 1)

Welcome to **VCS Classroom**. This repository is for practicing the key Git and GitHub concepts covered in class: repositories, commits, branches, merging, pull requests, collaboration, and (sometimes) conflicts.

## What you will practice
- Create and edit files in a repository
- Stage and commit changes
- Create branches for your work
- Push changes to GitHub
- Open a Pull Request (PR)
- Review someone else’s PR
- Merge PRs (maintainer only)
- Resolve a simple merge conflict (guided)

---

## Folder structure
- `students/`  
  Each student adds a short profile file.
- `notes/`  
  Class notes and glossary (maintainer adds, students may contribute via PR).
- `tasks/`  
  Weekly tasks and instructions.

---

## Rules (important)
1. **Do not commit directly to `main`.**
2. **Create a branch for every task.**
3. **Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into `main`.**
4. **Use clear commit messages** (example: `Add student profile: Jane Doe`).
5. **Be respectful in reviews**: be kind, specific, and helpful.
