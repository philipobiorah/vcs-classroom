## One thing I learned about VCS
VCS is really useful for keeping track of changes to code and collaborating with others. It allows you to see the history of your project and revert to previous versions if needed.

## What I want to build this term
I want to build a web application for a robot instruction manual. The idea is to create a user-friendly interface where users can input commands for a robot and see the results in real-time.
