## One thing I learned about VCS
I learned how version control helps track changes over time and makes collaboration much smoother. It also reduces the risk of losing work when experimenting.

## What I want to build this term
I want to create a project that lets me practice branching and merging in a real workflow. I’ll be applying this directly while working on my final‑year project.
